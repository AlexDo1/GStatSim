# GlacierStats
GlacierStats is a collection of functions and demos specifically designed for stochastic methods in glaciology. In my own research, I have found that geostatistical tools designed for industry applications do not have the flexibility to address the unique combination of challenges in ice sheet problems, including large crossover errors, spatially variable measurement uncertainty, extremely large datasets, non-linear trends, variability in measurement density, and non-stationarity. These tools are part of our ongoing effort to develop and adapt geostatistical techniques and other machine learning methods to spatial analysis in glaciology.

In its current state, the demos focus on the geostatistical simulation of subglacial topography. However, these protocols could be applied to a number topics in glaciology, or remote sensing problems in general.

We will continuously develop new tools and tutorials to address specific technical challenges in glaciology. Do you have feedback or suggestions? Specific things that we should account for? Feel free to contact me at mackie3@stanford.edu. Our goal is to create tools that are useful and accessible, so we welcome your thoughts and insight.
